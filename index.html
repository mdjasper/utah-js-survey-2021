      <h1><img src="logo.png" alt="" width="30"> 2021 UtahJS Survey Results</h1>
      <p>In December of 2021, a survey of UtahJS members was conducted through the group's slack channel around the topics of compensation, education, work locations, Covid-19, and other issues. There were 204 participants. Presented here are an analysis of the results, as well as some commentary, and a link to the raw result data.</p>

      <p><em>Tip: For charts with lots of data, hover over (or click) a chart series in the label to see those points highlighted.</em></p>

      <h2 id="demographics">Demographics</h2>
      <h3>I would consider myself a...</h3>
      <p>This year, members were asked to bucket themselves in to job-titles, such as "Junior Developer" or "Engineering Manager"</p>

      <div id="job-titles-chart" class="chart"></div>

      <h3>How much experience do people have in different roles?</h3>
      <div id="job-titles-experience" class="chart"></div>

      <h3>What are the experience levels for all of the survey respondents?</h3>

      <div id="overall-experience" class="chart"></div>

      <h3>Gender of respondents...</h3>

      <div id="gender" class="chart"></div>

      <h2 id="compensation">Compensation</h2>
      <p>This year, the survey included compensation questions about base pay (cash compensation), liquid equity (stock), non-reoccurring bonuses, pay changes from changing employers, as well as important benefits.</p>

      <h3>Cash Compensation aka Salary</h3>

      <div id="total-comp-with-nones" class="chart"></div>

      <h3>How does compensation change with experience?</h3>
      <div id="total-comp-by-experience" class="chart full"></div>
      <h4>Comparison to previous years</h4>
      <div id="comp-comparison" class="chart full"></div>
      <p>Tip: Hover over each year to highlight them individually</p>

      <h3>Total Comp (sum of salary, bonuses, and equity)</h3>
      <p>118 of 203 respondents (58%) received either a cash bonus, liquid equity, or both</p>
      <div id="received-non-cash" class="chart"></div>
      <div id="total-comp-by-experience-2" class="chart full"></div>
      <p>Of those that did receive equity or a cash bonus, what was it?</p>
      <div id="non-cash-comp" class="chart"></div>

      <h3>How does gender relate to compensation?</h3>
      <div id="salary-by-gender" class="chart full"></div>

      <h3>How does job title relate to compensation?</h3>
      <div id="comp-by-title" class="chart"></div>
      <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
      <h3>What is the distribution of education types?</h3>
      <p>Survey respondents could choose multiple options from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Self Taught (49)</li>
        <li>Some College (35)</li>
        <li>Bootcamp (88)</li>
        <li>Bachelor's Degree (110)</li>
        <li>Graduate Degree (15)</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="edu-breakdown.png" width="100%" alt="education breakdown graphic"/>
      <p>It is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32440128/nice-looking-five-sets-venn-diagrams-in-r/40048520#40048520" target="_blank">really challenging to represent the overlap of 5 options topologically</a>, so some of the smaller overlaps have been omitted in the above graphic.</p>
      <h3>Do different education types have different compensation distributions?</h3>
      <p>In the past, I've usually had a box plot showing the difference in compensation between, say, Bootcamp grads and Bachelor's Degree holders. After seeing several years of data, I now believe that this variation is mostly explained by experience. As time goes on, and the selection bias continues to work against bootcamp grads, I believe those that continue in their career will have comp on-par with their peers.</p>
      <div id="comp-by-edu" class="chart full"></div>
      <h3>What type of degrees do respondents have?</h3>
      <div id="degree-type" class="chart"></div>
      <p>While Computer Science Bachelors and Masters degrees remain the largest type of degree held, as a whole, they are a minority to non-computer-science degree holders.</p>

      <h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
      <h3>What are common benefits?</h3>
      <p>Respondents were asked about other benefits they thought were particularly good. Most common were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>100% paid health insurance</li>
        <li>Unlimited PTO</li>
        <li>Flexible schedule</li>
        <li>Paid parental leave</li>
        <li>Education stipends &amp; Reimbursements</li>
        <li>401k Matching</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Some new and upcoming benefits this year include:</p>

      <div id="raise-vs-move-box" class="chart"></div>
      <h2 id="covid-19">Covid-19</h2>
      <p>This year I asked some questions specifically about Covid-19 and the changes in work that have happened as a result.</p>
      <p>Very few people reported their employment being affected by Covid-19. Of those few that did, they were equally split between "received no raise because of the pandemic," and "received an extra raise because of the worker shortage."</p>
      <h3>Home office vs. Office office</h3>
